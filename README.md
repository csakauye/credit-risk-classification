# credit-risk-classification
Module 20 Challenge

Hello! 

I found the first half of the credit-risk-classification challenge to further build on what we learned in class. The second portion regarding resampled data was a bit more foreign but I was able to find an overview online. https://imbalanced-learn.org/stable/references/generated/imblearn.over_sampling.RandomOverSampler.html

Thanks!
